# cf-vcap-vars
### Purpose
Within Cloud Foundry there a number of runtime [environmental variables](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html) the help enable the deployed micro-service applications to maintain the [12-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/). As wonderful as that is, it would be really great to have a one-liner module that would read the runtime variables and make them accessible and follow DRY principals.

This module attempts to do just that.
